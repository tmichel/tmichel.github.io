This blog was born out the frustration and pain that I have to endure every day
due to the frameworks that are trying to be too clever. And because of that,
this blog probably will mostly consist of my ramblings and rants about software
and frameworks.

This is the nth attempt at keeping a blog regularly updated. I did fail most of
the time, but I'll never give up trying. I'll probably collect some of the older
posts from my other blogs and move them here and close up shop everywhere else.
