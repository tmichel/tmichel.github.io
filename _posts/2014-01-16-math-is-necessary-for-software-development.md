Math is always a tricky question. On a daily basis you might not _directly_ use
higher math, but everything you touch is built upon it. So math is actually
super important, and you should know _and_ understand the basic concepts. In the
long run you cannot live without knowing how the low level stuff works. You can
get by, but if you want to be a great (not a good) developer, then you must
understand the building blocks that you are using. You cannot choose the
appropriate hash function if you do not know what that is.

Math is everywhere in software development. Denying it would be completely
foolish. You can try to shield yourself from it, but eventually you will have to
sit down and understand how things really work. It doesn't matter if you do this
at a university or on your own, but you cannot avoid it.
