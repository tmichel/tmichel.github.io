Tam√°s Michelberger is a graduate student at [Budapest University of Technology and Economics][1]. His thesis work is about distributed model transformations which is mostly about trying to transform graphs using cloud infrastructure. The whole thing is written in C#, and hopefully it will be open source by time it's been finished. For the record, the exact title is _Distributed application of model transformations in Cloud Environment_.

If everything works out as planned he will graduate in May 2014.

Besides studying he is working at a Java shop and in [Kir-Dev][2] building web applications. He is a strong believer in _TDD_ and testing. He tries to apply it whenever he can. He also likes to try out the new shiny framework/language of the week, so at the end of the day he could go back to the same old battle-tested one and feel good about it again.

You can reach him on [twitter][3] or via email (tomi.michel at gmail.com).

[The very first post][4] written on this blog. It might not give you deeper insight, but it is a milestone nonetheless.
