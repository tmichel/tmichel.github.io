    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        Tam√°s Michelberger is a graduate student at
        <a href="http://bme.hu">Budapest University of Technology and Economics</a>.
        His thesis work is about distributed model transformations which is mostly about
        trying to transform graphs using cloud infrastructure. The whole thing is written in C#,
        and hopefully it will be open source by time it's been finished.
        For the record, the exact title is <i>Distributed application of model transformations in Cloud Environment</i>.
    </p>
    <p>If everything works out as planned he will graduate in May 2014.</p>
    <p>
        Besides studying he is working at a Java shop and in <a href="http://kir-dev.sch.bme.hu/about/english/">Kir-Dev</a>
        building web applications. He is a strong believer in <i>TDD</i> and testing.
        He tries to apply it whenever he can. He also likes to try out the new shiny
        framework/language of the week, so in the end he could go back to the same old
        battle-tested one and feel good about it again.

        <a href="{% post_url 2013-11-30-first %}">The very first post</a> writter on this blog. It might not give you
        deeper insight, but it is a milestone nonetheless.
